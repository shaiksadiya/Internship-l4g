    "Consider the following algorithm to generate a sequence of numbers. Start with an\n",
    "integer n. If n is even, divide by 2. If n is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Repeat this\n",
    "process with the new value of n, terminating when n = 1. For example, the following\n",
    "sequence of numbers will be generated for n = 22:\n",

    "22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1\n",

    "including the 1. In the example above, the cycle length of 22 is 16. Given any two\n",
